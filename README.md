# Robotics Software Engineer


This Repo contains all the projects from the Udacity's [Robotics Software Enginner Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209). There are five projects which are described below. All the projects uses ROS and gazebo simulator.

### Dependencies
- __Ubuntu 16.04__
- __ROS__ version >= __KINETIC__

### Build My World
In this project a world was created using gazebo simulator. A world plugin is also created to display a welcome message.

### Go Chase It
In this project a skid steer robot is designed with a camera
and Laser sensor. It is programmed to chase white ball in its field of vision.

### Where Am I
In this project the robot learns to localize itself given the map of the environment using Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization.

### Map My World
In this project the robot performs Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using the RtabMap algorithm.

### Home Service Robot 
In this project the robot first maps the environment
through SLAM and then plans a path to pickup and then to drop off location.
